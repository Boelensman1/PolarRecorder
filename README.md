## Beta Testing

Polar Recorder is currently in closed beta. I'm looking for testers to help improve the app before its public release.

To join the beta:

1. Join the Google Group: [Polar Recorder Beta Test](https://groups.google.com/g/polar-recorder-beta-test)
2. After joining the group, join the beta testing program: [Play Store Beta Testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.wboelens.polarrecorder)
3. Install the app from the Play Store: [Polar Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wboelens.polarrecorder)

I need at least 12 beta testers to proceed with the public release on the app store.

If you have any feedback/questions, please let me know via opening an issue or sending me an email at polarrecorderfeedback@wboelens.com.
