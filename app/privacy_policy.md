# Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 12 May 2025

Version: 2

## 1. Data Collection and Processing
Polar Recorder enables you to connect to Polar devices (such as heart rate monitors and biosignal sensors) and record the data they provide. Data recorded may include heart rate, ECG signals, accelerometer readings, and other biosignals provided by supported Polar devices. These biosignals are considered sensitive health data under GDPR and similar regulations. The app does not access location data, contacts, or any other unrelated personal information.

All such data is:
 - Processed exclusively on your device.
 - Stored only at user-selected locations.
 - Under your full control, including when and how it is recorded, saved, sent, or deleted.

I, as the developer, do not have access to the data collected by the app, nor is it transmitted to any server infrastructure under my control. The app supports exporting and sending data to user-selected locations/services (e.g., saving as file or sending via  MQTT). Note that data saved by the app as a file is done so unencrypted. Please be aware that biosignal data may be sensitive personal health information, it is strongly recommended to secure the stored data, including using appropriate protections such as encryption, PINs, or biometric locks.

The app does not include built-in logging or crash reporting functionality. However, platform-level diagnostics (e.g., ANRs, crash reports) may be collected by Google Play or the Android OS depending on user settings. These may include device model, OS version, and technical stack traces, but not biosignal or user-generated content. This collection is governed by Googleâ€™s privacy practices. The app does not include any other third-party analytics SDKs, crash reporting services, or external telemetry mechanisms.

## 2. No External Data Sharing
As the app only transmits data to user-selected destinations and does not send data to any server under my control, I (as the developer) do not:
 - Share any data with third parties.
 - Use your data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.
 - Transfer your data outside your device.

## 3. Permissions and Access
To function, the app may request access to Bluetooth (to connect with Polar devices) and local storage (to save biosignal data). These permissions are used strictly for the stated purposes and do not result in data transmission outside your device.

## 4. Your Rights
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have rights regarding personal data processing. However, as no personal data is transmitted or stored by me (the developer), and all processing occurs locally on your device, the exercise of GDPR rights must be carried out directly by the user.

## 5. Changes to this Policy
I may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the app or in legal requirements. Changes will be communicated through an update of this policy, which will be communicated within the app or its update notes, and will be published at https://boelensman1.github.io/PolarRecorder/app/privacy_policy.

All previous versions of this policy are also available in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Boelensman1/PolarRecorder). Users are encouraged to review this privacy policy periodically, especially after installing app updates.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact me by opening an issue in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Boelensman1/PolarRecorder) or by sending an e-mail to polarrecorderapp@wigger.email.
